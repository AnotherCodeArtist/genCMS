#genCMS
genCMS is a generic CMS based on play framework 2.2.1 (scala), mongoDB, securesocial plugin, knockout.js, sammy.js, leaflet.js, bootstrap,...

#run the application
in order to run the application you will need to install play framework (v 2.2.1) & mongoDB (v 2.4.8)
--> http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/PlayConsole 

#configuration
	/conf/application.conf
		Logging Configuration
	/conf/reactive-mongo.conf
		URI & authentication settings of your mongoDB instance
	/conf/securesocial.conf
		Smtp Settings used by the SecureSocial Plugin for sending Registration / Password E-Mails
		
#first start
you have to register a user using the registration form which can be found on the login page (“If you don't have an account with…”).
You have to provide a valid email address to finish the registration (a mail with a link will be send from the account configured in securesocial.conf).
The created user will not be administrator – the first administrator has to be set directly in the database by setting the users value “admin” to “true”.
Once you have an administrator in place you can add other registered users to the group of administrators using the Users Administration page.
